1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS)
- Android

2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift)
- Kotlin

3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development
- Yes

4. Include a brief explanation for your selections
- This is my first time developing a mobile app and I feel that an android app would be a good way to begin and test as well as I have an android device. Also, learning Kotlin could be helpful if I decide to develop a cross-platform app, then I could use Kotlin Multiplatform and migrating would be easier. I am also considering React Native as one of my choices for cross platform as I have a little experience with JavaScript.
